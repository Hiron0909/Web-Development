                This e-commerce website has been created for the students of Pabna University of Science and Technology
                (PUST) with the aim of making small-scale buying and selling easy, safe, and convenient within the
                university community. Many students often need to buy or sell products during their academic life,
                especially items that are no longer needed or are required for a short period. This platform provides a
                simple solution to connect buyers and sellers from the same campus. <br><br>

                The website allows students to buy and sell a wide range of products, including second-hand and new
                items. Common products listed on the platform include laptops, mobile phones, mobile stands, tables,
                chairs, laptop stands, study accessories, and many other daily-use items. By focusing on the university
                community, the platform ensures better trust, faster communication, and affordable pricing.<br><br>

                This system helps students save money by purchasing second-hand products at reasonable prices and also
                gives them the opportunity to earn money by selling unused items. The website is designed to be
                user-friendly so that students can easily post product details, browse available items, and contact
                sellers without any complexity.<br><br>

                Overall, this e-commerce platform promotes reuse, affordability, and convenience among PUST students
                while encouraging a supportive and connected university marketplace.
